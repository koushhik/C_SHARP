----------@-------------@@--------------@@@@---------@@-------------@----------
VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: IF YOU ARE NEW TO PROGRAMMING 
1) DONT THINK THE PROGRAM IS TOO LONG AS :
   ANYTHING WRITTEN INSIDE // or /* in between  */ IS CALLED COMMENTS WHICH CAN BE IGNORED ...I HAVE WRITTEN IT FOR YOUR UNDERSTANDING AND MY REFERENCE OFFCOURSE ............IT WILL NOT BE EXECUTED........

2)THE LINE:
   (```csharp)

   to last line

   (```)  SHOULD ALSO BE IGNORED AS IT IS USED FOR GIT HUB STYLING ... IF YOU USE IT IN CODE EDITOR IT WILL GIVE ERRORS...!!

3)YOU DO NOT NEED TO USE ALL THE STARTING HEADER WHICH LOOKS LIKE 
using System;                                                                              
       (using System.Collections.Generic; )                      
          (using System.Linq;)                          
                  (using System.Text;)                                 
                        ( using System.Threading.Tasks;)                              

USING ONLY :
using System;
is sufficient , unless stated or required.

SO OVERALL YOUR PROGRAM AFTER REMOVING EVERYTHING FOR QUESTION NUMBER ONE :

1)program to print Hello and your name in a separate line
SHOULD LOOK LIKE THIS :
