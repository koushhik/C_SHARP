            a = b; //then a will be empty ,as a value is assigned to temp ....so we push b value to a as a = b; (reverse)
            b=temp; // then b will be empty so we push temp valure ...which has a value stored ....will be pushed into b...thus making proper swap.

            Console.WriteLine("AFTER SWAP : " + a + " " + b);   //WE DISPLAY NUMBERS AFTER THE SWAPPING IS DONE.
